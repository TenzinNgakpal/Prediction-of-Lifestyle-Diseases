# Prediction-of-Lifestyle-Diseases

The increasing prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, is concerning worldwide, particularly with more and more lifestyles becoming sedentary and diets becoming poor. These diseases are categorized as non-communicable diseases, and they develop over time and often go unnoticed until they become consequential, so it becomes important to detect them early for effective treatment and prevention. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning (ML) model that predicts the likelihood of multiple lifestyle diseases based upon the individualâ€™s health information and behavior. The intended outcome is an accurate early-warning system for lifestyle-related diseases that facilitates health awareness and preventive care. The dataset used included important health indicators such as age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, and lifestyle factors of smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. A MultiOutputClassifier built on top of a Random Forest Classifier was used to predict multiple diseases simultaneously, these diseases being diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. This offered the opportunity to predict multiple diseases efficiently using one input system. The model is trained and developed using a cleaned and structured dataset that achieved good accuracy for all target labels. The project also includes a web-enabled interface built in Flask to permit users to enter their health information and obtain a real-time assessment of their risk of disease. 

By integrating machine learning, web application technology and user experience techniques, we have made the tool accessible to non-technical persons, primary care providers and health-minded citizens. By giving early indications of possible health risk, this system may help prompt users to seek timely medical advice or make lifestyle changes towards better health. In this way, the model encourages reducing the burden of chronic diseases and fosters a culture of proactive health monitoring. The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning to contribute to better preventive health and healthier communities.
